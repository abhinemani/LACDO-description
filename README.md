Host regional collaboration events amongst SoCal governments
Set a national precedent for data and knowledge sharing through deep collaboration with the county, other area cities, etc that ease access to meaningful data for citizens / developers
Priorities
These serve as simple statements of priorities/approaches for PR purposes (need to be wordsmithed).
Support data-driven policy making within city hall
Move beyond transparency: push for meaningful use of data and easy access to information that matters to the people it matters to
Develop capacity within the organizations within city hall -- leave a legacy outside MOBIE
Connect performance management and budgeting with technology through data
Following industry best practices around developer relations, support local developers and startups with hands-on engagement and community building
Get the data and the apps/tools into the hands of people that need them through aggressive outreach programs
Leverage the community’s capacity in civic engagement: LA has passionate citizens, world-class  universities, and active foundations, all eager to get involved. Data and MOBIE’s operations broadly give them a way to get involved.
